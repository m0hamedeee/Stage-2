# COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF P53 PROTEIN STRUCTURE USING HOMOLOGY MODELING AND ALPHAFOLD

## Introduction
p53 is a tumor suppressor protein involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. It’s often called the "guardian of the genome" because it helps maintain genomic integrity by repairing DNA or inducing cell death when damage is irreparable. The TP53 gene is located on chromosome 17, encodes p53 and controls cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 disrupt these functions, leading to uncontrolled cell division and tumor formation (Canale et al., 2022).

## Structural Domains and Function of p53 Protein
p53 consists of several key domains:
* **N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD, residues 1–61)** activates transcription by binding coactivators.
* **Proline-rich domain (PRD, residues 64–92)** is involved in signal transduction and apoptosis.
* **DNA-binding domain (DBD, residues 96–292)** binds DNA to regulate gene expression, crucial for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
* **Tetramerization domain (TET, residues 324–356)** allows p53 to form functional tetramers, essential for its activity.
* **C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD, residues 364–393)** controls p53 activity through post-translational modifications, influencing its DNA binding and stability.
